# TalkingtoThemselves
This python & R scripts and raw data are from Yuhan Li's term paper, "Talking to Themselves": How the Politicization of Climate Change Leads to Polarized and Disconnected Individuals in Post-video Discussions, for the political science class in the 2021 fall semester.
Note that the scripts should still work, but some of the packages used in them have evolved in the past half-year. Please check the packages before you run these codes and modify them according to your needs.
